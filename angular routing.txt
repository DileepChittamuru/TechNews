
Routing & Navigation:
======================

	Angular Routing enables you to navigate from one view to another as users perform application tasks

	import { Router, RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';

	RouterLink RouterLinkActive and RouterOutlet are directives provided by the Angular RouterModule package.
	They are readily available for you to use in the template.

	RouterLink ==> we use it instead of href
	RouterLinkActive ==> toggles css classes for active link
	RouterOutlet ==> place holder for components
	pathMatch ==> 
	wild cards ==> when url does not match ass page not found 
	
Router features:
			1 guards,
			2 resolvers,
			3 child routing
			
		
	imports: [
  BrowserModule,
  FormsModule,
  HeroesModule,
  AppRoutingModule
],

The order of route configuration matters. 

1 at the end of each successful navigation 

Router service builds an ActivatedRoute object that holds the current state of router. 

CanActivate to mediate navigation to a route.

CanActivateChild to mediate navigation to a child route.

CanDeactivate to mediate navigation away from the current route.

Resolve to perform route data retrieval before route activation.

CanLoad to mediate navigation to a feature module loaded asynchronously.
